THE MAN consisted entirely of letters. Innumerable letters, of course - an astronomical number of them, but nothing else.
His girlfriend, as anyone could see, consisted of flesh and blood - and what flesh and blood! It was a pleasure just to look at her, let alone touch her.
The two of them went to the fair together. The swingboats and the Ferris wheel were fine, but then they came to a shooting gallery. A rather peculiar shooting gallery, admittedly.
TR Y YOUR LUCK! it said in big letters on the marquee. Below was a list of rules. There were only three:
1. Your first shot is free.
2. Every shot a guaranteed bull's-eye.
3. Every bull's-eye wins you one free shot.
The man studied these rules intently with his arm around his girlfriend's waist. He was itching to move on, but she urged him to take advantage of such a generous offer. She wanted ro-see how good he was.
He said he wouldn't. 
'Why not, honey? What's the problem?'
The problem was the unusual nature of the target. You had to shoot yourself, or rather, your own reflection in a metal mirror, and the man composed ofletters felt far from real enough to draw such a hazardous distinction between himself and his mirror image.
