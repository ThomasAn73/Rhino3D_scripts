Harmony Distribution Script

Presentation:
	-Include link to latest RhinoScript when anouncing.

Interface:
	-Quickest route = Equidistance and  Alignment
	-Supply toolbar buttons for alignment and distribution (equidistance)
	-Consider an Html dialoge box
	-if there is control surface enabled then x,y,z act as multipliers for the respective axis (otherwise they are regular displacement, rotation or scale values)

	-Without control surface -->
		align "ceiling distribution" (ceiling is an imaginary flat surface)
		equidistance (similar to illustrator distribute function)
		jitter rotational, 
		jitter translational
		jitter scale
		Rotation (jitter of zero randomness)
		Translation (jitter of zero randomness)
		scale (jitter of zero randomness)

	-With control surface -->
		align "ceiling" distribution
		Zdelta displacement
		controlled distance
		controlled jitter (rotational)
		controlled jitter (translational)
		controlled jitter (scale)
		controlled rotation
		controlled translation
		controlled scale


	-Menu System
		-First prompt: Select target objects

		-Second prompt: (Main menu)
			Summary: [Equidist=Yes] -- [Align=none] -- [Displacement=0,0,0,no] -- [Rotate=0,0,0,no] -- [Scale=1,1,1,no] -- [Jitter=0,0,0,no]
			Equidistance, Alignment, Move, Rotate, Scale, Jitter, HandleFrom=Center
				Equidistance submenu:
					Equidistant along: Xaxis, Yaxis, Zaxis, none
					Equidistant between: (sub menu)
						Handles, BoxEdges
				Alignment submenu: 
					Align to: axisX, axisY, Surface, none
				Move submenu:
					axisX=0, axisY=0, axisZ=0, Controlled=No
				-Rotate submenu:
					Rotate amount (degrees): axisX=0, axisY=0, axisZ=0, Controlled=No
				-Scale submenu:
					Scale amount: axisX=1, axisY=1, axisZ=1, Controlled=No
				-Jitter submenu:
					Jitter amount: axisX=0, axisY=0, axisZ=0, Controlled=No
				-Handle submenu:
					Select object-handle percentage location in bounding box coordinates. Center is at x=0.5, y=0.5, z=0.5
					Handle point:  BoxAxisX=0.5, BoxAxisY=0.5, BoxAxisZ=0.5

		-Third prompt: Select control surface.
Known issues:
	-Groups are not honored. It is best (for now) to turn groups into blocks for use in the script.
	-Clean up error handling and reporting
	-Progress indicators not yet implemented
	-If clusters of objects are lined up perfectly (say on the vertical) then perfoming equidistance on the horizontal the result is not sorted top to bottom and left to right
